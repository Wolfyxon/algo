# Algorithms and math

This is my repo where I make various algorithms to exercise and stuff as that will be useful in fields 
such as data analysis, graphics ~~and job interviews~~.

Also some math related stuff, since I really struggle in school with math topics that I see no use in, so this will help me 
better understand then and perhaps find a practical use.
